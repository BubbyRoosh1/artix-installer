# artix-installer

Two scripts used to install a base system of [artix linux](https://artixlinux.org/).
Mostly follows the [installation guide](https://wiki.artixlinux.org/Main/Installation). Only made so you don't need to waste *so much time* typing all the commands and stuff.

## Use
1. Boot into the artix [liveCD](https://artixlinux.org/download.php)
2. Install git: `pacman -Sy git`
3. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/BubbyRoosh1/artix-installer` (May require a reinstall of glibc)
4. Enter the directory: `cd artix-installer`
5. Run the installer: `./ArtixInstaller`
